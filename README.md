Browser Javascript client for Centrifugo
========================================

Please note, that with version 1.3.0 client API was completely refactored ([changelog](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#130)).

See client [documentation](https://fzambia.gitbooks.io/centrifugal/content/clients/javascript.html)

If you want to contribute, install dependencies and run `gulp` command from root repo folder - this results
in creating build file in `build` directory.
